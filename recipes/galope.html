    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Galopé is a traditional Brazilian dish, known for its rich and hearty
        flavors. This savory delicacy is a fusion of rooster (galo) and pig's trotters (pé de porco), creating a
        dish that is both comforting and robust. </p>
    <p>The slow-cooked amalgamation of meats, seasoned with a blend of spices, results in a dish that pays homage to the
        culinary heritage of Northeast region and Minas Gerais, offering a taste of Brazil's diverse and delicious
        cuisine.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole free-range rooster, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>2 pig's trotters, cleaned and cut into sections</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>1 bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped half cilantro</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, sautéing until
            they become fragrant and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the rooster pieces and pig's trotters to the pot, browning them on all sides.</li>
        <li>Stir in the diced tomatoes, bell pepper, green onions, and cilantro, allowing the vegetables to soften and
            release their flavors.</li>
        <li>Season the mixture with salt, black pepper, and add the bay leaves for additional depth of flavor.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water, ensuring that the meats are partially submerged. Bring the pot to a boil, then reduce the
            heat to low and let it simmer, covered, for about 1.5 to 2 hours or until the meats are tender and the
            flavors meld together.</li>
        <li>Adjust the seasoning to taste and remove the bay leaves before serving.</li>
        <li>Galopé is traditionally served with rice, beans, and a side of couve (collard greens) and farofa (toasted
            manioc flour). </li>
    </ol>
