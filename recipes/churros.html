    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Churros are a Spanish treat, renowned for their crispy exterior and tender, doughy interior. These deep-fried
        delights are often coated in cinnamon sugar, providing a perfect balance of sweetness and spice.</p>
    <p>Enjoyed on their own or dipped in chocolate sauce, churros are a beloved indulgence that brings a touch of warmth
        and nostalgia with every bite.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine water, sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Bring the mixture to a
            boil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from heat and add the flour, stirring vigorously until the mixture forms a ball.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil for frying in a deep fryer or large pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Pipe strips of dough directly into the hot
            oil, cutting with scissors at the desired length.</li>
        <li>Fry the churros until golden brown, turning them with tongs to ensure even cooking. Once done, place them on
            a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll the warm churros in the mixture until evenly
            coated.</li>
        <li>Serve the churros on their own or with a side of chocolate sauce for dipping. Enjoy the irresistible
            combination of crispy, sugary goodness with each delicious bite.</li>
    </ol>
